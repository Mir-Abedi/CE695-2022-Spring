\subsection{a}
We can model the problem as an HMM. The hidden states are the state of weather and the observed states are if her mother has recieved any flower today. 
Hidden state transition probabilites are given as:
$$
P_H = \begin{bmatrix}0.7&0.3\\0.3&0.7\end{bmatrix}
$$
The first row corresponds to the weather being good and the second row is weather being bad.

\noindent Also for the observation probabilites:
$$
P_O = \begin{bmatrix}0.75&0.25\\0.5&0.5\end{bmatrix}
$$
The first is the weather being good and the First column is the probability of her mother getting an origami.
\subsection{b}
Now we can calculate the stationary probability for hidden states:
$$
\pi = P_H\pi \rightarrow (P_H - I)\pi = 0 \rightarrow \pi_H = \begin{bmatrix}0.5\\0.5\end{bmatrix}
$$
Then for any given day $\expected[O_i] = \expected[\expected[O_i|H_i]]$.
$$
\expected[\expected[O_i|H_i]] = 0.5\times0.75 + 0.5\times0.5 = 0.625
$$
On a course of 3650 days (10 years), the expected number of flowers can be obtained by:
$$
3650\times0.625
$$
\subsection{c}
First condition on the next three days. We need to calculate the following probabilites.
$$
\prob[\text{Two origamis} | \text{3 good days}] + \prob[\text{Two origamis} | \text{2 good days and 1 bad day}] + \prob[\text{Two origamis} | \text{1 good day and 2 bad days}] + \prob[\text{Two origamis} | \text{3 bad days}] 
$$
$$
= 0.75\times0.75\times0.25
$$
$$
+ 3\times(0.75\times0.75\times0.5 + 0.75\times0.25\times0.5 + 0.25\times0.75\times0.5)
$$
$$
+ 3\times(0.75\times0.5 + 0.25\times0.5\times0.5)
$$
$$
+ 0.5^3
$$
\subsection{d}
$$
\prob[GGG] = 0.7\times0.7\times0.75\times0.25\times0.25
$$
$$
\prob[GGB] = 0.7\times0.3\times0.75\times0.25\times0.5
$$
$$
\prob[GBG] = 0.3\times0.3\times0.75\times0.5\times0.25
$$
$$
\prob[GBB] = 0.3\times0.7\times0.75\times0.5\times0.5
$$
$$
\prob[BGG] = 0.3\times0.7\times0.5\times0.25\times0.25
$$
$$
\prob[BGB] = 0.3\times0.3\times0.5\times0.25\times0.5
$$
$$
\prob[BBG] = 0.7\times0.3\times0.5\times0.5\times0.25
$$
$$
\prob[BBB] = 0.7\times0.7\times0.5\times0.5\times0.5
$$
So the most probable event is BBB.

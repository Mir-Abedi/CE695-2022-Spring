First starting from T:
$$
\prob[TTAC] = \prob[X_1 = T|X_0 = T]\times\prob[X_2 = T|X_1 = T]\times\prob[X_3 = A|X_2 = T]\times\prob[X_4 = C|X_3 = A]
$$
$$
= 0.25\times0.25\times0.25\times0 = 0
$$
$$
\prob[GGCGG] = \prob[X_1 = G|X_0 = T]\times\prob[X_2 = G|X_1 = G]\times\prob[X_3 = C|X_2 = G]\times\prob[X_4 = G|X_3 = C]\times\prob[X_5 = G|X_4 = G]
$$
$$
= 0
$$
Starting randomly:
$$
P = 0.25\times\prob[\text{Starting from T}] + 0.25\times\prob[\text{Starting from A}] + 0.25\times\prob[\text{Starting from G}] + 0.25\times\prob[\text{Starting from C}]
$$
Note that $\prob[TTAC]$ is always zero because of $\prob[X_{i + 1} = C|X_i = A] = 0$.
$$
\prob[GGCGG] = 0.25\times0 
$$
$$
+ 0.25\times 0.125\times0.125\times0.5\times0.25\times0.125
$$
$$
+ 0.25\times 0.25\times0.125\times0.5\times0.25\times0.125
$$
$$
+ 0.25\times 0.5\times0.125\times0.5\times0.25\times0.125
